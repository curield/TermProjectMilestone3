How to Play the Movable Parrot Game;

When the page loads with the background jungle photo and all of the parrots are visible, then it is time to play the game.

To play the game you must click on the parrot you would like to move, 
and hold down the mouse until the parrot is in the position of your choice. 

The idea of the movable parrot game is to have fun being creative. 

You can create your own jungle paradise filled with parrots. 

They can fly over the waterfall.

They can sit in the water for a swim.

It's your time to have fun and imagine being in the jungle
with parrots flying  all around having fun!
